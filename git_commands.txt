Once you're in the repository, pull the latest changes from the remote (usually origin) and the branch you're working on 
(for example, main):

git pull origin main
This command fetches and integrates the latest changes from the remote repositoryâ€™s main branch into your local repository.

If you're working on another branch (e.g., dev), you can specify that branch:

git pull origin dev
3. Ensure you're on the correct branch:
If you're unsure which branch you're on, you can check with:

git branch
This will show a list of branches, with an asterisk (*) indicating the currently active branch. 
If needed, switch to the correct branch using:


git checkout <branch_name>
Then pull the latest changes for that branch.
