To create a new branch in Git and switch to it, you can use the following command:
git checkout -b <branch_name>
checkout -b: This creates a new branch and switches to it immediately.
to create a branch called feature-xyz:
git checkout -b feature-xyz

Pushing the New Branch to GitHub. After creating the branch locally, you will typically want to push it to GitHub. 
To do that, use:
git push -u origin <branch_name>
For example:
git push -u origin feature-xyz
The -u flag sets the upstream reference, so future pushes and pulls on this branch can be done without 
specifying the remote and branch name.
